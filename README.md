Central Limit Theorem Calculator (Alex Mun, Steve Briceno)

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is probabilistic law which states that the mean 
of a sample population will be normally distributed (bell-shaped) provided that 
there are enough members in the sample. The CLT Calculator will accept as inputs: 
1.) a set of sample data points, 2.) the standard deviation and, 3.) a confidence 
level, which determines the margins of error in calculating the confidence interval. 
The CLT Calculator will then output the 1.) sample mean, 2.) sample variance, 
3.) error margin, and 4.) the confidence interval.

Elements of the Unix Philosophy incorporated into the CLT Calculator are: 1.) 
Rule of Clarity, 2.) Rule of Simplicity, and 3.) Rule of Modularity. The Rule of 
Clarity and the Rule of Simplicity will be used in designing the core algorithm 
of the CLT Calculator by minimizing the amount of extraneous operations required to 
execute the Central Limit Theorem, while maintaining a consistent style to aid
the reader in traversing the code. The Rule of Modularity will be enforced through
the usage of short, concise functions that all perform a single, clear task.

Features to be added in a future commit:
1.) Error Checking for Inputs
2.) Additional Commenting for Functions and Main
