Central Limit Theorem Calculator (Alex Mun, Steve Briceno)

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is probabilistic law which states that the mean 
of a sample population will be normally distributed (bell-shaped) given that 
there are enough members in the sample. The CLT Calculator will take as inputs 
1.) a set of sample data points, 2.) the standard deviation and, 3.) a confidence 
level, which determines the tolerance to which the standard error of the sample 
distribution strays from the mean. The CLT Calculator will then output the 
1.) sample mean, 2.) sample variance, and 3.) the confidence interval.

Elements of the Unix Philosophy incorporated into the CLT Calculator are 1.) 
Rule of Clarity, 2.) Rule of Simplicity, and 3.) Rule of Parsimony. The Rule of 
Clarity and the Rule of Simplicity will be used in designing the core algorithm 
of the CLT Calculator by minimizing the number of variables and functions needed 
to execute the Central Limit Theorem. If these two rules are enforced, then the 
Rule of Parsimony should naturally follow as the final size of the program 
should use only the minimum amount of code required to correctly output the
sample mean, sample variance, and the confidence interval.
